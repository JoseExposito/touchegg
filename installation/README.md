# Installation Files

## touchegg.conf - _Touchégg configuration file_

This file handles all of the default gestures on installing Touchégg.

## touchegg.desktop - _Touchégg application XDG desktop entry file_

This file contains a combination of meta information resources and a shortcut to the Touchégg application, in accordance with the [XDG Desktop Entry specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html) which defines a standard for applications to integrate into application menus of desktop environments.

This file is installed into the system-wide XDG Autostart directory (`/etc/xdg/autostart`), which allows autostarting ordinary desktop entries on desktop environment startup.

## touchegg.service - _Touchégg systemd service_

This service runs Touchégg in daemon mode (`touchegg --daemon`) as part of the "input" group.
The daemon will open a Unix domain socket so any service (usually `touchegg --client`) can have access to libinput's multi-touch gestures.
